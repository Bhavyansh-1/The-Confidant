      <p >This is an initiative by a community, trying to redefine the way to engage in mental health. Mental health is still too often surrounded by stigma and the reason for this stigma occuring is lack of knowledge and negative attitude. This negative attitude comes from the misguided views that these individuals are "different" from everyone else. While on the contrary to this, as per the research, WHO estimates that about 7.5 percent indians suffer from some mental distress and predicts that by the end of this year, roughly 20 percent of india will suffer from mental illness. So this is a small step taken to not only spread awareness about the importance of mental health in your life but also to provide a platform where you can freely talk about it.</p>

      <p >The early stages of the pandemic and lockdowns were hard on all of us in different ways - isolation, joblessness, losing our loved ones, heartbreak, domestic violence and many other challenges. Many found it hard hard to cope with the grief and isolation, and others found it hard to deal witg job loss and financial insecurity. So here we are trying to make a small effort to deal with the ongoing pressures and challenges. So, anyone going through any kind of emotional or mental distress is whole heartedly welcomed to our place. We will try to help you vent out and heal from your wounds.</p>
